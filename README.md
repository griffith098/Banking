# Banking System Web Application
## Introduction
This is a web-based **Banking System** that provides users with a platform to manage their accounts and banking services efficiently and securely. The application offers core functionality like user login and access to banking services through an intuitive web interface built using modern technologies.
The landing page of the application welcomes users and provides navigation to login or other services. The application's architecture is built around JSP (Java Server Pages) for UI rendering and potentially servlets for backend business logic.
## Technologies Used
The project leverages the following technologies:
1. **Java**:
    - Used for implementing the server-side business logic.
    - Servlets may be used to handle HTTP requests and generate dynamic web content.

2. **JSP (Java Server Pages)**:
    - Used for creating the user interface.
    - Dynamic HTML is generated using JSP files.

3. **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**:
    - **HTML**: Structure of web pages.
    - **CSS**: Styling for enhancing the visual presentation of the application.
    - **JavaScript**: Used for front-end validation and dynamic interactions.

4. **Apache Tomcat** (or any other web server/servlet container):
    - Used for deploying and running the web application.

5. **Directory Structure**:
    - Follows the standard Java Web Application directory structure, including `WEB-INF`, JSP files, and static resources (CSS, JS, etc.).

## Instructions to Use the Application
### 1. Prerequisites
Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** (version 8 or higher)
- **Apache Tomcat** (or any other compatible servlet container)
- **Maven** (if the project is Maven-based) or **Gradle** (if Gradle-based)
- An IDE like **IntelliJ IDEA** or **Eclipse** (optional, but recommended for development)
### 2. Setting Up the Project
1. **Clone the Repository**: Download or clone the source code from the version control system (e.g., GitHub).
2. **Import the Project**:
    - Open the project in your preferred IDE.
    - If the project uses Maven or Gradle, it will automatically detect dependencies. Otherwise, ensure to set up the build path for Java.
3. **Verify the Directory Structure**
  

## Future Enhancements
- Add database integration for user authentication and account management.
- Create RESTful APIs for enhanced modularization and scalability.
- Implement additional features such as transaction history, fund transfers, and notifications.
